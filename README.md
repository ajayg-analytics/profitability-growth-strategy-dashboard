# Category Profitability & Growth Strategy Intelligence Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project started with a simple question:

Is the business actually becoming more efficient, or are we just selling more volume?

Using the AdventureWorks dataset, I built a Power BI dashboard to evaluate growth quality, profitability concentration, and category-level performance behaviour.

The goal was not just to visualize sales, but to understand where profit is really coming from and whether current growth is structurally strong or volume-driven.

## Key Business Questions

- Is growth driven by volume expansion or margin improvement?
- How concentrated is profit across product categories?
- Which categories show future efficiency potential but lack scale today?
- Are we scaling smartly or just scaling fast?

## Key Insights

- Business growth between 2010–2013 is largely volume-driven, with margin % remaining structurally flat.
- Profit contribution is heavily concentrated in the Bikes category, indicating stability but also concentration risk.
- Accessories show strong margin profile but remain under-scaled relative to their profitability potential.
- Volume and margin trends together reveal that efficiency gains are limited despite demand growth.
